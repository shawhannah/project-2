myIPA - Never Forget Your Favorites

This app was created as an easy, convenient way to save those special IPAs the moment you taste them.
If you're familiar with IPAs, then you know the taste spectrum for these beers is vast and eclectic. 
There are weird IPAs, boring IPAs, thick IPAs, smooth IPAs. You get the picture. 
Unfortunately, when an IPA is bad, it can be really, really bad. 
So bad that you don't want to ever down those beers again. Ever. 
This app can help you avoid that by keeping track of all the IPAs you've loved. 
You just type in the beer name and brewery and it's added to your Beer List. 
So, next time you're deciding between two and can't remember which you liked, just pop
open this app and see what's on your list. 

While this is great for all our IPA drinkers out there, we want to make it even better. 
As the Beer Lists get longer, we want to add features that will allow you to have not only 
lists of the good IPAs, but the bad too. The "Never Again" list, so to speak. 
And we may love IPAs, but we don't discriminate. We plan to build out this app to include beers
of all kinds so that you can have your favorites in one place. 

Stick with us and you won't be disappointed. Drinking has never been easier.
